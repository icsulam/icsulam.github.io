  Hello!

  I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Political Science at the University of Rochester.

  My areas of study are statistical methods and American politics with a focus on the judiciary, ideal point estimation, and text analysis.

* [Editor in Chief: Opinion Authorship and Clerk Influence on the Supreme Court](/pdf/EditorInChief.pdf)
<p class="message">
    Despite increasing use of the content of legal opinions to make inferences on the behavior of the judiciary, little attention is paid to the process that generates these documents. This article contributes to the ongoing discussion on the role and function of clerks by addressing conceptual, methodological, and empirical concerns that have hampered investigating the content of Supreme Court opinions. Conceptualizing influence in terms of the language adopted into the opinion, I assess the extent that Supreme Court opinions reflect the language of the clerks, and examine the responsiveness of this influence to the policy incentives of the justices. Overall, the results indicate that concerns over clerk influence are generally overstated and that the opinions of the Supreme Court reflect and respond to the policy incentives of the justices.

* [Oversight and Indeterminacy: Using Cross Country Variation in Institutions to Understand the Operation of Precedent in Judicial Systems](/pdf/crossCountry.pdf)
<p class="message">
    This study seeks to add to the current understanding of how judicial institutions mediate the expression of the personal attributes of judges and application of stare decisis on common law courts of last resort. We analyze an original data set consisting of all published opinions of courts of last resort in Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom from 1950-2014. We find that neither the introduction or removal of appellate oversight significantly alters either the voting behavior or policies adopted by these courts.  However, the expression of ideology and creation of policy outputs is dramatically changed when courts gain increased control over their dockets. These results suggest that legal, rather than strategic, concerns are of paramount importance for judicial decision makers. We argue that comparative analysis of court structure can leverage within-country institutional variation to understand the general function of institutional features.
