Being someting of a stats-nerd, my first thought was to use math (statistics) to understand language, particularly vocabulary. Vocabulary is often used as a measure of how sophisticated a writer is. A large vocabulary is thought to indicate someone's intelligence, status, and expertise at a subject matter.  Declining vocabulary is typically used to indicate the 'dumbing down' of subject matter.
